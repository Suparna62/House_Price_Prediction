# House Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project predicts house prices using machine learning based on features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, age of the house, and parking availability. The model is trained on house price data to estimate prices for new properties.

## Features
- Train a machine learning model on historical house price data.  
- Predict prices for new houses based on input features.  
- Easy-to-use Python implementation with clear visualizations.  

## Dataset
The dataset `house_prices.csv` includes the following columns:  
- **area**: Size of the house in square feet  
- **bedrooms**: Number of bedrooms  
- **bathrooms**: Number of bathrooms  
- **age**: Age of the house in years  
- **parking**: Number of parking spaces  
- **price**: Price of the house in lakhs  

Sample data:

| area | bedrooms | bathrooms | age | parking | price |
|------|----------|-----------|-----|---------|-------|
| 850  | 2        | 1         | 15  | 1       | 45    |
| 950  | 2        | 1         | 10  | 1       | 50    |
| 1200 | 3        | 2         | 8   | 1       | 75    |
| 1500 | 3        | 2         | 5   | 2       | 90    |
| 2000 | 4        | 3         | 7   | 2       | 120   |
